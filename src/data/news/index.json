UniCredit provided debt financing.\n\nForum Ústi nad Labem is one of the 10 busiest shopping centres in the Czech Republic, attracting 8.6 million visitors a year, even as three other centres have opened in its catchment area since 2013. The property is located in the city centre. Its anchor tenant is the Billa supermarket chain, while other occupiers include Adidas, H&M, C&A, New Yorker, Tommy Hilfiger, Nike, Deichmann and a five-screen Cinema City. Ústi nad Labem is close to the German border, is an important junction in the pan-European railway network and on the route of the main motorway linking Prague to Berlin.\n\nThis is MBERP's second disposition after last year it sold its 50% interest in the Bentall Centre in Kingston-upon-Thames, near London, to an Asian institution. Advising MBERP on the disposition were Cushman Wakefield, Tomsa, and PWC. Advising NEPI on the acquisition were Clifford Chance and E&Y.","tags":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"k3gh61z1i0f4"}},"id":"5FLr7ljbskMGoMY44mYGI0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2016-08-30T10:03:49.551Z","updatedAt":"2016-08-30T10:03:49.551Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"tagLocation"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"location":"Europe"}}],"tagsOther":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"k3gh61z1i0f4"}},"id":"2VpyYkXoZ2wg4AwMuaWMww","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2016-09-02T10:57:05.461Z","updatedAt":"2016-09-02T10:57:05.461Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"tagsOther"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"attribute":"Investment"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"k3gh61z1i0f4"}},"id":"5PmvUC3FDOkIgMSiCy44G2","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2016-09-02T10:57:16.347Z","updatedAt":"2016-09-02T10:57:16.347Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"tagsOther"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"attribute":"Procurement"}}],"prevArticleUrl":null,"nextArticleUrl":null}],"tags":["Europe","Investment","Procurement"]}
